% Fourier Subspace Fitting
% I'm taking only those with signal to noise larger than "1.5" using below
% command:
f_s=find(s2n>1.5);
% Here are these modes
% f_s= 22    43    44   128   147   255   274   358   359   380
% But these modes are not symmetric around zero and does not necessarily
% give a real output. To have a symmetric spectrum I'm shifting the middle of
% spectrum to the zero in this way:
f_ss=find(s2n>1.5)-201;
%these new modes are:
% f_ss = -179  -158  -157   -73   -54    54    73   157   158   179
% Howerver, after examining through plotting and compairing with the
% original data I felt that it has higher rate of ocsilation, so here I'm
% introducing another set of frequency by mirroring the lower half of the
% original one:
f_sm = [-flipud(f_s(1:5))+1;f_s(1:5)-1];
% these morored modes are:
% f_sm =  -146  -127   -43   -42   -21    21    42    43   127   146

%Here below I'm defining the coef matrix for this new set of basis as well
%as the inhomogenity vector of the equation for above three series of modes

% DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PLOTS
% Qualitativly I can say that non-symmetric model and the mirrored one
% models the slow oscillation of the data in better way. But the problem
% with the non-symmetric one is that it has larg imaginary part. The
% mirrored model is kind of asymmetric in negative and postive region.
% The shifted model seems more noisy and even looks that has more variation
% rate that the data itself, and this sense it resembles the face of the
% data. I think in the first looking it's more similar than others to the
% data, but I think that this resemlance is because of more noisy behaviour
% of this model.
% But a general point which is true about all of these models is that they
% got a smaller amplitude, roughly  than the original data
